This github was created with the codes used for the project "Mapping a Mucilage - Algal bloom event in the Northern Adriatic Sea using the Sentinel Constellation, August 2024" for the course Copernicus green solutions
of the Politecnico of Milan. 
The results and graph were made using as a interface the annaconda enviroment (using jupyterlabs), Sentinel application platform (SNAP) and the copernicus data ecosystem to download the specific date data (08/10/24 and 08/11/2023). 
The codes used are modification of the codes at disposition at the EUMESTAT/Copernicus jupyter labs resource disposition (notesamplebookss) from the site (https://documentation.dataspace.copernicus.eu/Usecase.html), with the authors:
